# **Description**

This assignment serves as a budget tracker. When the app is loaded, the user is presented with a blank page that provides form areas for 'Name of Transaction' as well as 'Transaction Amount'. When these form fields are filled out, the user is able to select whether they would like to add or subtract funds in the amount that they have provided. Upon the first entry, a chart is created, and as values are added to the database, the chart is procedurally generated with the given values. The top of the page provides an area that displays the users current amount of money.
